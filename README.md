# LitePy
LitePy is a very simple tkinter Python script editor i made in my free time. The whole editor is in ONE python script.
![The editor with the script open](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1081636827896741890/1300929364392935526/image.png?ex=6722a062&is=67214ee2&hm=fb48e7a9e6e91a21a691b0e9f13658d49a568f816c58a9c6a5bd8b519680310e&)

## Features
It pressing `F5` will run the current script in the python interpreter.
It also comes with syntax highlighting although it just imports the idlelib Colorizer library so if you don't have Idle installed the highlighting wont work.
